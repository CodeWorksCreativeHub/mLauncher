## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). We expect all contributors to communicate respectfully and maintain a positive, inclusive environment.

## Getting Started

All contributions are made via **Issues** and **Pull Requests (PRs)**.

- **Check existing issues and PRs** before submitting new ones.  
- Friendly comments or pings can help maintainers notice important or blocking issues.  

### Using GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, track issues, and accept PRs.

### Pull Requests

We follow a **fork-and-pull Git workflow**:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.  
2. Clone your fork locally.  
3. Create a descriptive branch.  
4. Commit your changes following formatting and testing guidelines.  
5. Push changes to your fork.  
6. Open a PR using the template.  

**Best practices for PRs:**

- Address one concern per PR.  
- Focus on a single functionality or widespread style fixes, not both.  
- Keep changes minimal for easier review.  
- Use the PR template for clarity.  

For major changes or breaking updates, open an issue first to discuss your proposal.

### Issues

Use issues to report bugs, request features, or discuss potential changes.  

- **Check for existing issues** and add your input rather than opening duplicates.  
- Use [reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to signal impact.  
- **Report bugs with detail**:  

  - Summary or background  
  - Steps to reproduce (include code if possible)  
  - Expected vs. actual behavior  
  - Notes on potential causes or prior attempts  

### Code Style

- Use **4 spaces** for indentation (no tabs).  
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout your code.  

## License

All contributions are under the **GPL-3.0 License**. By submitting changes, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same terms as this project.
