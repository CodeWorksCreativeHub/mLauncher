Forked from <a href="https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher">Olauncher</a>. Minimal and clean.

# Forked with extra features

- Removed clutter, like ads and links.
- You can rename apps in the app-drawer (Renaming apps on the home screen is already supported. Just long-click on an app on the home screen and start typing.)
- We have added a lot more options for gestures on the home screen:
    - Gestures are now:
        - Swiping up, down, left, right
        - Clicking on the clock
        - Clicking on the Date
    - Possible actions now include:
        - Open specified app
        - Display app list
        - Locking the screen
        - Show Recent opened apps
        - Opening the notification drawer
        - Opening the quick settings
        - Power Dialog
        - Take A Screenshot
        - Disable Gesture
- You can also position the clock independently of the home apps.
- Change alignment of apps in app-drawer independent from homescreen.
- Change font size of sections of the homescreen independent of each other.
- Removed internet permission. You never know what an app developer wants to know about you.
- Lock settings behind biometrics (toggle)
- Added the ability to report crashing via email.
- Added the ability to view app usage time.
