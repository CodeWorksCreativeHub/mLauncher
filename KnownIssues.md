# Known Issues

This document lists known issues in the project and possible workarounds.

## 1.7.5 - mLauncher [Release Notes](https://github.com/DroidWorksStudio/mLauncher/releases/tag/1.7.5)

### üì± Issue: Icons and Usage Problems

- **Cause:** The usage prevents the icons from functioning properly. If you want the icons to work, avoid using the "usage" feature. I'm unsure if I'll fix this issue.

## 1.7.4 - mLauncher [Release Notes](https://github.com/DroidWorksStudio/mLauncher/releases/tag/1.7.4)

### üõ†Ô∏è Issue: `isManagedProfile()` Requires API 30+

- **Cause:** The method `UserManager.isManagedProfile(userHandle)` requires API 30 or higher, but the minimum SDK version of this project is lower.
- **Fix Coming Soon:** Use `val isWorkProfile = appListItem.user != android.os.Process.myUserHandle() && !isPrivateSpace` as a workaround for API
  versions below 30. For an example, see the implementation in [
  `AppDrawerAdapter.kt`](./app/src/main/java/com/github/droidworksstudio/mlauncher/ui/AppDrawerAdapter.kt).

## 1.7.3 - mLauncher [Release Notes](https://github.com/DroidWorksStudio/mLauncher/releases/tag/1.7.3)

### üö® Issue: `NoSuchMethodError` for `getLauncherUserInfo()`

- **Cause:** The method `getLauncherUserInfo()` is missing in some Android versions.
- **Fix Coming Soon:** Use `UserManager.isManagedProfile()` with a compatibility check.
  See [this discussion](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/UserManager#isManagedProfile()).

### üõ†Ô∏è Issue: `isManagedProfile()` Requires API 30+

- **Problem:** `UserManager.isManagedProfile(userHandle)` requires API 30, but our `minSdkVersion` is lower.
- **Fix Coming Soon:** Use reflection for API < 30. See the implementation in [
  `AppDrawerAdapter.kt`](./app/src/main/java/com/github/droidworksstudio/mlauncher/ui/AppDrawerAdapter.kt).

### üì± Issue: 3-Button Navigation Doesn't Leave Space at the Bottom of Settings

- **Cause:** When 3-button navigation is enabled, the bottom area of the settings screen is not properly adjusted, leading to content being cut off or
  obscured.
- **Solution:** Use **gesture navigation** as a workaround, which doesn't have the same issue with screen space. To enable gesture navigation, go to *
  *Settings > System > Gestures > System navigation** and choose **Gesture navigation**.
- **Fix Coming Soon:** A fix is in progress, and we will add a spacer to the bottom of the pages to resolve this issue.
